# Landing page with Create React App: standard functionality and interface

Hi there! 
This is my pet-project. The design was found on the Internet, now it's in the "images" folder.

## Preview

It gives me great pleasure to present my project to you. Follow the [link](https://barbylka.github.io/goCorona/) and take a look at my vision for the function of sales pages. 

Since I'm just getting started, I'd be interested in the opinions of experienced colleagues and tips for improving the page.

## Functions
Let's pretend that you are a company that wants to sell your mobile app through your website. üí≠ What kind of Landing Page would you want?

On such a page, I have implemented a comprehensive functionality for your tasks. The user will be able to:
1. use the menu at different resolutions
2. descend to the page blocks of interest
3. see all the information you want to see
4. view a YouTube video (or your own) about the app without leaving the page
5. go straight to the store of your platform and download the app

Of course, you can also add a popup window here, with sending the users's details to get a discount. I implemented a popup for that, and adding a form to it is a couple of knick knacks. Or maybe do you want something else in the popup, not a form?

I've tried to implement popular features that I see most often on info-landing pages.

## Design

Here is my principled position: the site should be both beautiful and comfortable. Here for me there are no important and unimportant sides, priorities and points. Therefore, I paid special attention to this.

Let's return to our fairy tale.

You plan to sell your app to any user, of any region and age. 

1. üì± Mobile-First. Of course, the main audience will be users coming from your social media accounts. It is very convenient to navigate within your phone. That's why I optimize the application by starting the development with the mobile version.

2. üì∫ Television, why not? Yes, it's unlikely that someone will decide to open your site via TV (although why not? I do it sometimes, smart TV is a useful and convenient technology). What about wide monitors? Many people use them now. I tried to implement the site in such a way that we do not have content in the middle and sides on the edges. But in my opinion this is old-fashioned.

3. üë©‚Äçüé® UICS and Adaptive layout. Be reassured that your application will open on the fifth iPhone and on the TV in all its glory. Elements will stand where the user is comfortable, visible and intuitive. The movements of the user's finger or mouse on the screen are predictable, so let's apply that here as well. Users are already used to the location of menus and buttons, so let's not annoy them üò° with our design decisions and scare them away from our application.
